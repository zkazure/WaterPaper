## Install & Environment

Python dependencies are managed with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Run from the
**repository root**:

```bash
uv sync                              # create .venv and install all dependencies (required)
uv run playwright install chromium   # chart rendering needs a browser (required for charts)
```

- `pyproject.toml` declares dependencies and `uv.lock` pins them; `requirements.txt` is an
  `uv export` artifact for non-uv environments (`pip install -r`) — **do not edit it by hand**
- All `tools/` commands are invoked as `uv run python tools/xxx.py` (the docs already use this form)
- The PDF path additionally needs TeX Live, see the note under Quick Start below

## Quick Start

Send the GitHub URL or the path to your local copy of this project to your AI coding assistant (Claude Code / Codex / Trae / Cursor, etc.) and say:

```
Install this skill for me: https://github.com/ThisIsLittleSky/WaterPaper.git
```

The AI agent will handle the setup automatically.

Once installed, just say what you need:

```
Use this skill to write a final paper on mobile communication technology, 4000 words, use 模板.docx as the format template.

Help me reduce the AI detection score for my paper: [paper path], [plagiarism report.html (optional)]
```

The AI will walk through the full pipeline: **get template → propose topics → crawl references → build outline → write body → generate charts → deliver .docx**

School LaTeX templates are supported too — output lands as a PDF (plus a compilable `.tex` source):

```
Use this skill to write a final paper on mobile communication technology, 4000 words, use my school's LaTeX template template.tex, produce a PDF
```

The pipeline is identical to the Word one (topics / references / writing / de-AI / de-plagiarism all
share the same Markdown intermediate); only format extraction and final output differ:

```
template.tex → template analysis (engine / packages / injection point / layout params / compile probe)
             → inject body into the template shell (cover, declaration page and TOC preserved)
             → latexmk compile → paper.pdf + paper.tex
```

When the template is incomplete (no `\begin{document}`, no injection point, or it fails to compile),
the skill falls back to a built-in skeleton and **tells you explicitly that your template was not used,
and why** — it never pretends to have used it.

> Requirement: the PDF path needs TeX Live installed locally (`latexmk`, `ctex`, `xeCJK`).

## Why You Need This

Finals week. N course papers stacked on your desk. The process is always the same:

> Brainstorm topics → search references → read papers → outline → hit the word count → tweak formatting → lower AI score → submit

WaterPaper.skill automates all of it:

| Step | Manual Approach | LLM Client | WaterPaper.skill |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Topics | Struggle to come up with 1 | AI generates topics, no real ref support | One sentence → 5 angles × 2 topics = 10 choices |
| References | Crawl CNKI, Wanfang, copy-paste | ❌ Fabricates references — titles & authors look real but don't exist | Multi-source crawler: auto fetch, deduplicate, verify |
| Formatting | Adjust line by line against a template | Manual format description, no precise replication | Upload .docx template → auto-extract → strict replication |
| Charts | Draw in Excel, screenshot, paste | Cannot generate or crude output | HTML-rendered publication-quality SVG charts → auto-insert |
| AI Reduction | Manually rephrase formulaic sentences | No AI reduction capability | D0–D7 seven-dimension constraints + PaperPass 5-pattern scan + 9 rewriting techniques |
| Plagiarism Reduction | Rewrite duplicate passages by hand | No plagiarism reduction capability | Deep semantic rewriting + perspective shifting + citation merging |

> The fatal flaw of LLM clients: **they fabricate references** — titles, authors, and journals that look real but don't exist. WaterPaper.skill sources all references from actual CrossRef / Semantic Scholar / Baidu Scholar retrievals. Each entry is annotated with its source and verifiability status; unverifiable entries are discarded.

You only need to do two things: **state what you need** and **make choices**. The scripts handle the rest.

## Literature Data Sources

| Source | Access Method | Chinese Coverage | Reliability | Rate Limit |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| CrossRef | REST API (free) | Moderate | ✅ High | 50 req/s |
| Semantic Scholar | REST API (free) | Moderate | ✅ High | API-key controlled |
| Baidu Scholar | Web scraping | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Medium (needs verification) | — |
| CNKI | Web scraping | ✅ Best | ⚠️ Low (strict anti-scraping) | — |

> For Chinese-language papers, we recommend Baidu Scholar as the primary source, supplemented by CrossRef/Semantic Scholar for English references. CNKI has aggressive anti-scraping measures — failures are expected and won't block the overall pipeline.

## Paper Structure (Course Papers)

| Word Count | Chinese Refs | English Refs | Chapter Structure |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| 3000–4000 | 4–6 | 1–2 | Introduction + 2 body chapters + Conclusion |
| 4000–6000 | 5–7 | 2–3 | Introduction + 2–3 body chapters + Conclusion |
| 6000–8000 | 6–8 | 2–4 | Introduction + 3 body chapters + Conclusion |

Supported disciplines: Business & Management, Humanities & Social Sciences, Science & Engineering, Case Analysis.

## Chart Types

- Bar chart (category comparison)
- Line chart (trend visualization)
- Flowchart / Framework diagram (theoretical frameworks, research processes)
- Data table (multi-dimensional comparison)
- Pie chart / Donut chart (proportion display)

All charts are HTML/SVG-rendered at 2x DPR for high-definition output, with an academic color palette.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Can it replicate the weird formatting in my school's template?</b></summary>

Yes. `analyze_template.py` parses the .docx file paragraph by paragraph, extracting font, size, bold, alignment, line spacing, spacing before/after, first-line indent, and page breaks for every element, producing a structured JSON. `generate_paper_docx.py` then strictly reproduces the formatting from that JSON.

If your template has formatting beyond the script's analysis scope (e.g., custom headers/footers, watermarks), you can manually edit `style_profile.json` to supplement.

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Will the paper be flagged as AI-generated by plagiarism checkers?</b></summary>

**WaterPaper.skill has two lines of defense, battle-tested on PaperPass:**

**First line: AI Reduction (D0–D7 seven-dimension constraints + PaperPass 5-pattern scan)**

- Integrates the thesis-optimizer project's 30+ AI pattern taxonomy and 3-tier vocabulary blacklist
- D0 Minimal intervention: in-sentence micro-adjustments, no wholesale AI-style rewrites
- D1 Sentence length distribution: actively creates short-long alternation, breaking AI's bell-curve sentence length pattern
- D2 Paragraph structure: 5 templates randomly rotated, adjacent paragraphs never share the same structure
- D3 Information density: high-density core paragraphs alternating with low-density transitions ("high-low-high" rhythm)
- D4 Connective word control: red high-risk words ("furthermore", "crucially", "in summary") deleted outright; yellow medium-risk words density-controlled
- D5 Terminology context: heavy tier enables terminology variants
- D6 Logical humanization: breaks AI's linear "problem → method → conclusion" logic, preserves exploratory meandering
- **D7 Parallelism kills**: CNKI/PaperPass are extremely sensitive to parallel structures — "first/second/third", "firstly/finally" are shattered, replaced with fragmented sentences and line-break segmentation
- After writing, `humanize_check.py` runs automatically (including parallelism detection); delivery is blocked until it passes

**Second line: Plagiarism Reduction (deep semantic rewriting)**

- Standard definition passages: reorganize word order, avoid textbook-style phrasing
- Literature review passages: categorize and merge citations, no literature laundry lists
- Method description passages: add "why this method was chosen" motivation
- Conclusion passages: replace generic summaries with specific findings
- Full terminology protection throughout (discipline-specific abbreviations, mathematical models, citation numbers are never touched)

After receiving the final draft, we recommend reading through it once and adding your own perspectives and course-specific content. WaterPaper is a tool, not a ghostwriter.
